I am a research fellow (postdoc) 
at the [Department of Mathematics](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/) 
of the [University of Padova](https://www.unipd.it/) 
in Italy (EU), under the supervision of 
[Davide Vittone](https://www.math.unipd.it/en/department/people/user.php?usertype=2&user=364). 
I obtained a double PhD degree in 2017
from the [University of Jyväskylä](http://www.jyu.fi/en/) (Finland, EU) and from the [University of Trento](http://www.unitn.it/en) (Italy, EU), 
under the supervision of [Enrico Le Donne](https://sites.google.com/site/enricoledonne/) and [Francesco Serra Cassano](http://www4.unitn.it/People/it/Web/Persona/PER0004233#INFO).

**Metric Geometry** and **Geometric Measure Theory**, together with  **Lie Group Theory**, are my main areas of research, with particular emphasis on problems that arise in **Geometric Group Theory**, **Analysis on Metric Spaces** or in **sub-Riemannian Geometry**.

Primarily, I study Lie groups equipped with non-Riemannian distances such as **Carnot-Carathéodory distances**. 
Motivated by the asymptotic geometry of nilpotent groups, I work on **Carnot groups**. 
In particular, I am interested in the regularity of submanifolds such as **metric spheres** and **minimal surfaces**.

If you want to know more about me, here is my [CV]().
