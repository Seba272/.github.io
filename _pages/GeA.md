**On the geometry of soap films and soap bubbles**

**_Andrea Marchese_** (Università di Pavia)

_Abstract:_ 
I will discuss a recent result establishing that area minimizing
m-dimensional currents modulo p in any codimension are regular submanifolds
outside a singular set of Hausdorff dimension at most m-1, moreover the
singular set is rectifiable and of locally finite Hausdorff measure for odd
values of p. Joint work with Camillo De Lellis, Jonas Hirsh, and Salvatore
Stuvard.

**Geometry of 1-codimensional measures in the Heisenberg groups**

**_Andrea Merlo_** (Pisa)

_Abstract:_
Characterisation of rectifiable measures in Euclidean spaces through the existence of the density has
been a longstanding problem for Geometric Measure Theory until the complete answer by D. Preiss
in 1987. The question of how in more general metric spaces existence of density can affect any kind
of gain in terms of regularity of the measure is a completely open problem.
In this talk I will discuss how the mere existence of the 1-codimensional density for a measure in
the Heisenberg groups endowed with the Koranyi metric implies that almost everywhere the tangents
to the measure are flat.
