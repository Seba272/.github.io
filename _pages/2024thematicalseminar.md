The goal of this thematic seminar is to provide students with the opportunity to present a mathematical topic in a seminar format.
This cycle of seminars will focus on sub-Riemannian geometry.

Sub-Riemannian geometry is a rich field of study that connects differential geometry, metric geometry, analysis on metric spaces, and the theory of groups and Lie groups. 
Sub-Riemannian geometry has applications in control theory and appears as limit of Riemannian spaces and as asymptotic cones of finitely generated groups, among other contexts.

The primary reference for this course is "Lecture Notes on Sub-Riemannian Geometry" by Enrico Le Donne. An online version is available at [this link](https://sites.google.com/view/enricoledonne/teaching/lecture_notes).
