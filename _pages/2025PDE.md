---

This semester, I will be teaching a course on Partial Differential Equations (PDE), based on L. C. Evans' "Partial Differential Equations". 
The course is intended for third-year undergraduate and master's students.

The course is structured around the study of the three most important differential equations:
the Laplace, heat and wave equations.
These three equations have been the source of numerous mathematical developments, both pure and applied.
We will commence by learning the classical methods for deriving properties of their solutions.
Subsequently, we will delve into a more advanced approach, studying distributions, Sobolev spaces and weak solutions. 
These theoretical instruments will enable us to introduce new methods for investigating PDE.


Weekly schedule:
Monday and Tuesday, 13:15 - 15:00, in PER 23, Room 0.05
